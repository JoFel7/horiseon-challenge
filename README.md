# Horiseon Challenge

## Description

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive tools like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. While making a website more accessible this can help the business allowing the respective website to rank higher in search engines. It also helps companies avoid legal trouble, which may accur due to people with disabilities being unable to access or navigate the site. By consolidating the selectors and properties, re-organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page, increasing the efficiency while working with CSS.
